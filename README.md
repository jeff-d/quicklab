Create simple, monitored labs.
```

QuickLab includes four components:

- a private network
- a bastion host
- a managed kubernetes cluster
- monitoring

QuickLab uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to create its components in AWS, and uses [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/) for monitoring.

QuickLab aims to enable builders and tinkerers by offering a ready-made playground that's "[well-architected](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)" and flexible enough for a variety of projects.

QuickLab is designed to create lab _infrastructure_ only (and only the above-listed components). Once a QuickLab is created, users are free to deploy _applications_ or create additional lab resources.

## Use Cases

In no particular order:

- software development
- application and infrastructure deployment
- telemetry collection and analysis
- cybersecurity attack simulation (and detection) range

**Bonus:** Anything else you might think of! Once your network with bastion and/or cluster are created you can use them to create any number of scenarios that call for a VM or a kubernetes cluster!
